MDâ†’RT
=====

A lightweight macOS menu bar app that automatically converts copied Markdown text to Rich Text formatting while preserving the original.

âœ¨ **What it does**
- Watches your clipboard for Markdown text
- Automatically adds rich text formatting (bold, italic, headers, lists, links, code blocks)
- Keeps both the original Markdown AND the formatted version
- Works seamlessly with your existing clipboard manager
- Uses external API for accurate Markdown conversion with browser-style formatting

ðŸš€ **Quick Start**

**One-liner (recommended):**
```bash
pipx install convert-md-to-rt && md2rt-menubar
```

**Alternative methods:**
```bash
# From source (developers)
git clone https://github.com/taazkareem/convert-md-to-rt.git
cd convert-md-to-rt
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
md2rt-menubar
```

**How to use:**
- Copy any Markdown text (like `**bold**` or `# Heading`)
- Paste into rich text apps (ClickUp, TextEdit, Word, etc.) â†’ you'll see formatting!
- Paste into plain text apps â†’ you'll see original Markdown
